The Interactive Library Management System(ILMS) is a cutting-edge,
all-inclusive system created to improve user experience and transform library
administration. The goal is to create an application that can be used on mobile devices
and the web to simplify and automate certain library tasks. An intuitive user interface,
advanced search options, and a user forum for book reviews and discussions are some
of the ILMS's standout features. The system will also provide detailed author
information, book previews, and efficient circulation management, including return
dates, waiting lists, and pre-booking options. For the benefit of both library
employees and users, the overall goal of the ILMS is to produce a smooth, effective,
and enjoyable library experience.
